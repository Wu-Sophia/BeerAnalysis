## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide Budweiser with actionable intelligence on where to sell new products and what products to sell. These conclusions were reached by utilizing the data provided by Budweiser executives. The approach we used was to identify certain characteristics within the beer market data and then comparing those findings to the country as a whole to identify pockets of untapped opportunity. The code below is used to extract and draw conclusions from the available data.

This file describes the purpose of the project and codebook.
Determining the has several actors that are both internally and externally controlled. The natural forces of demand and supply play a major role as will be seen subsequently. With a desire to understand the major causative factors, several data have been collected and evaluated.  

The Analysis part provides answers to the demands which include the followng:
Provide detail on the beer Market Data Set and any associated issues.
Describe the Beer Characteristics within the overall market.  

Show points of interest within the data  

Give information regarding the alcohol content between beer types.  

Present the relationship between alcohol and bitterness.

## Conclussion:  
The conclusions that we can draw from this exercise are that differences exist between various parts of the country in terms of types, strengths, and flavors or beer.  These differences have shown us that certain geographies within the US are lacking in types of beers available.  We hope to use this data to create a selling opportunity for Budweiser by selling Cider in a market where Cider does not currently exists, despite being popular in other parts of the country.
